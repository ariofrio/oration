## Roadmap

**Version 1.0**

 - Azure: It works again.
 - Azure: Do logging in the code, not in the service definition.
 - Azure: Upload logging to a service like [Logentries][] (they have native
   support for Python and Java) [Loggly][], or [PaperTrail][].
 - AppEngine: Support for Java.
 - AppEngine: Add a README.md with instructions (or a link).
 - Both: More accurate error reporting on frontend.
 - Both: Test suite for harness (Azure) and apps (AppEngine, Azure).
 - Both: Clean up the API.
